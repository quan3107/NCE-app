-- File: backend/src/prisma/migrations/20251010043344_init/migration.sql
-- Purpose: No-op migration retained to preserve Prisma migration ordering.
-- Why: The prior init migration (20251008120500_init) already creates the schema. This file prevents
--      duplicate enum/table creation errors during deploy while keeping history stable.
