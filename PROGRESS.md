## Backend

- **2026-07-24:** Closed database-bootstrap review findings by stripping sensitive owner-child environment names case-insensitively, requiring raw demo confirmation, closing the CMS external pool, and making database-test cleanup failure-safe. Added spawned-child and lifecycle regressions, split runbook assertions, and archived older progress entries.

- **Archived milestone:** PR-40 introduced the NCE content schema and `seed:nce-content`; full details remain in the backend archive.

## Frontend

- **2026-07-24:** No frontend application files changed for the backend owner-job, seed-lifecycle, and database-test cleanup fixes.
